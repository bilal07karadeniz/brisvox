# Capacity: pipecat 8 vCPU / 8 GB, cloud (AMD EPYC 9655P)

- command: `brisvox-bench capacity --url ws://server/... --floor-ms 860 --slo-over-floor-ms 250 --label pipecat 8 vCPU / 8 GB, cloud (AMD EPYC 9655P) --note <see server> --steps 1,5,10,20,40,80,120,160,240,320,400,480,560,640,800,1000,1200 --fixtures-dir /opt/fixtures --resolution 10 --rounds 2 --client-workers 8 --out-md capacity-pipecat-cloud-8c-linux-2026-10-16-run2.md --out-json capacity-pipecat-cloud-8c-linux-2026-10-16-run2.json`
- brisvox 0.1.1 (release build), linux x86_64, 8 logical cores, 8 tokio workers (threads, not a CPU limit: other threads may use any core)
- live: a server at the URL; the load generator is this process (8 tokio workers, the worker count in the line above)
- target: `ws://server/...`
- server: cloud containers (AMD EPYC 9655P, Linux), server limits 8 vCPU / 8 GB (cgroup cpu.max and memory.max, checked from the samples); the fake providers and this load generator ran in containers of their own; server CPU and memory per step from the server container's cgroup samples every 2 s (steps[].target)
- every call replays `en_two_utterances` (2 utterances) in real time; 2 call(s) per slot, slots start spread over 4000 ms; steps [1, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 120, 160, 240, 320, 400, 480, 560, 640, 800, 1000, 1200]; 1 warm-up call(s) first, not counted
- SLO: p95 V2V at most floor 860 ms + 250 ms = **1110 ms**, no failed call, at most 0.0 % of turns lost or not clean; a healthy step in which more than 1.0 % of the frames went out over 100 ms late is generator limited
- CPU / memory of the server: not read by the generator (no pid); per step in the .json (steps[].target), from the server container's cgroup samples

**Result: max 5 concurrent calls within the SLO**; the next step up did not pass (first failure at 10).

Why steps did not pass:

- 10 concurrent: p95 V2V 1111 ms is above the limit 1110 ms (floor 860 ms + 250 ms)

Percentiles are nearest-rank over the answered turns of the step; with fewer than 20 samples p95 is the largest or second largest sample, and a mock-provider run measures the framework, not the providers (see `docs/LATENCY.md`).
