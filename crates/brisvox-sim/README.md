# brisvox-sim

Mock STT, LLM and TTS providers, a deterministic simulator on a virtual clock, and the scenario suite that every brisvox pipeline must pass.

`fixtures_dir()` points at the `fixtures/` folder of a repository checkout; the speech fixtures are not part of the published crate.

This crate is part of [brisvox](https://github.com/bilal07karadeniz/brisvox), a Rust engine for real-time voice agents: phone calls and
browser sessions where a caller talks, the agent listens, thinks (an LLM, with tools) and answers,
and the caller can interrupt at any moment. The crates are versioned and released together; the
whole picture (architecture, configuration, deployment, benchmarks) is in the
[book](https://bilal07karadeniz.github.io/brisvox/) and the [repository](https://github.com/bilal07karadeniz/brisvox).
